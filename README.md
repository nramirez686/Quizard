Coding Quiz

## **Project Description**

This project is a coding quiz. I tried to recreate the example that was given to us as close as possible.
There was some struggle with the style but and after going over third-party API's I was able to incorporate some of what I was learning to this code.

## **How To Use The Project**

You can begin the quiz by clicking the "Star quiz" button.
Once you start your quiz, you will have 30 seconds to answer the question.
Incorrect questions will deduct 10 seconds of your time.
After you finish the quiz, you will get a score of all correct questions.
